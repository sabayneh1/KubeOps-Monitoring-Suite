can you also note that it needs a metric server  to make it work for prmetous A note about the metric server: you need to know that the Metric server exposes a new API through the API server. You can hit the metrics.k8s.io to get more info about that:
sudo snap install jq
k get --raw /apis/metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1 | jq "."                            and here is how to to get grafans password k get secret grafana -o jsonpath='{.data}'            and need to decode the password this way If you see the user name is like "YWRtaW4=" you need to decode it by the following command:
echo "YWRtaW4=" | base64 --decode            and to make grafana and premetous work to gether we need toa dd premetous  in grafan by going to data sources and add data source  and then addd the url of the premeous server then wee will able to grab the metric from premeous so we can show it in grafana  and to add diffrent dashbords that we can use for grafan we have to go to https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards and then we chose the dasbored we like and copy the dasboard id and then come back to the Grafthe ana dashboard.--> Import. and pout the id we copy from the previus step and import the dashboard    can you initigrate this additonal information to the above

User
is there away to make the above nicer like for example format and headers, codes can be easily copy for my readme.md instesd of copy and paste, they can click copy, things like that 
GPT
To enhance the readability and functionality of your README.md for GitHub, I'll incorporate the additional details you provided and format the document to be more engaging and user-friendly. This will include clear headers, formatted code blocks for easy copying, and instructions for integrating Prometheus with Grafana. I'll also introduce a "Copy" button feature through markdown; however, please note that GitHub's markdown does not natively support a "click to copy" button. Users can easily select and copy code snippets, but for a one-click copy feature, you'd need to use external tools or services integrated with your project's web page.
