'''
# Explanation:
# - This manifest defines a deployment for an application named "app-b".
# - It runs 3 replicas using the Nginx image.
# - Labels are used to identify pods and group them logically.
# - The `affinity` section specifies how pods should be placed on nodes:
#     - `podAntiAffinity`: Avoids placing pods with the same type (application-B) on the same node unless necessary.
#     - `nodeAffinity`: Ensures pods are only scheduled on specific nodes (node1, node2, node3) and avoids nodes with type "application-B".

# Please note that this is a simplified example and you might need to adjust it based on your specific needs and environment.
