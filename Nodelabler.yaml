# This ensures the DaemonSet runs on all nodes in the cluster,
# even if they have taints that would reject normal pods.

'''
# Explanation:
- This manifest defines a DaemonSet named "node-labeler" that runs
  on all nodes in the cluster.
- It uses tolerations to allow running on nodes with taints.
- The container labels nodes with the specified label and value.
- Environment variables and ConfigMap access configure the labeling process.
- Volume mounts provide necessary information for authentication and time-based operations.

Remember, this is a simplified example and you might need adjustments based on your specific needs and environment.
