'''
Explanation:
- This manifest defines a deployment for an application named "app-a" associated with the "demo-project".
- It runs 3 replicas using the Nginx image.
- Detailed labels enhance identification and management.
- Resource limits and requests ensure performance and stability.
- The `affinity` section specifies how pods should be placed on nodes:
    - `podAntiAffinity`: Like in the previous example, avoids placing pods with the same type (application-A) on the same node.
    - `nodeAffinity`: Ensures pods are only scheduled on specific nodes (not provided in this snippet) and avoids nodes with type "application-A".

Remember, this is a simplified example and might need adjustments based on your specific needs and environment.
